## Course Policies
1. Academic Integrity
    - You are allowed to get descriptive help from anyone, including the instructor, TAs, friends, and Internet sites.
    - You must not turn in code that you did not write. Any student who violates the [Academic Integrity](#academic-integrity) policy will receive a zero on that assignment.
4. Class participation counts, including in-classroom interaction, online help, and office hours. 
5. Neatness counts. Take the time to write clean code. We will discuss.

## University Policies

### Students with Disabilities
If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact USF Student Disability Services (SDS) at (415) 422-2613 within the first week of class, or immediately upon onset of disability, to speak with a disability specialist. If you are determined eligible for reasonable accommodations, please meet with your disability specialist so they can arrange to have your accommodation letter sent to me, and we will discuss your needs for this course. For more information, visit the [SDS website](http://www.usfca.edu/sds). 

### Behavioral Expectations
All students are expected to behave in accordance with the [Student Conduct Code](http://www.usfca.edu/fogcutter/). Students whose behavior is disruptive or who fail to comply with the instructor may be dismissed from the class for the remainder of the class period and may need to meet with the instructor or Dean prior to returning to the next class period. If necessary, referrals may also be made to the Student Conduct process for violations of the Student Conduct Code.

### Academic Integrity
As a Jesuit institution committed to cura personalis -- the care and education of the whole person -- USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code. You can find the [full text of the code online](https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/).

The policy covers:

- Plagiarism: intentionally or unintentionally representing the work of another person as your own; failure to properly cite references; manufacturing references.
- Working with another person when independent work is required.
- Submission of the same work in more than one course without the specific permission of each instructor.
- Submitting work written by another person or obtained from the Internet.

Here are some useful resources related to sexual misconduct:
